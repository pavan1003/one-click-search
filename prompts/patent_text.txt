The present technology relates to interatrial shunting systems and methods. In some embodiments, the present technology includes interatrial shunting systems that include a shunting element having a lumen extending therethrough that is configured to fluidly couple the left atrium and the right atrium when the shunting element is implanted in a patient. The system can also include an anchoring mechanism coupled to the shunting element and configured to secure the shunting element within the patients heart. A common symptom among heart failure patients is elevated left atrial pressure. In the past, clinicians have treated patients with elevated left atrial pressure by creating a shunt between the left and right atria using a blade or balloon septostomy. The shunt decompresses the left atrium (LA) by relieving pressure to the right atrium (RA) and systemic veins. Over time, however, the shunt typically will close or reduce in size. More recently, percutaneous interatrial shunt devices have been developed which have been shown to effectively reduce left atrial pressure. However, these percutaneous devices often have an annular passage with a fixed diameter which fails to account for a patient's changing physiology and condition. For this reason, existing percutaneous shunt devices may have a diminishing clinical effect after a period of time. Many existing percutaneous shunt devices typically are also only available in a single size that may work well for one patient but not another. Also, sometimes the amount of shunting created during the initial procedure is later determined to be less than optimal months later. Accordingly, there is a need for improved devices, systems, and methods for treating heart failure patients, particularly those with elevated left atrial pressure. The present technology is generally directed to interatrial shunting systems. The systems can include a shunting element implantable into a patient at or adjacent a septal wall. The shunting element can fluidly connect a LA and a RA of the patient to facilitate blood flow therebetween. In some embodiments, the device further includes an anchoring mechanism coupled to the shunting element. The anchoring mechanism can be configured to secure the shunting element to a desired location in the patient's heart (e.g., to the septal wall between the LA and RA). The anchoring mechanism can include one or more flanges, tethers, anchoring elements (e.g., hooks, barbs), expandable or inflatable elements, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the shunting element is balloon-expandable. For example, a method of implanting a shunting element in a patient can include inserting a balloon member into a lumen of the shunting element while the shunting element is in a contracted delivery configuration. The shunting element can be positioned within an aperture in the septal wall of the patient while in the delivery configuration. The shunting element can then be expanded to an expanded configuration by inflating the balloon member.
