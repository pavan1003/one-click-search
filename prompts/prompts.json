    "prompt1": "Here is a description of an invention: '{{patentText}}'  As a skilled patent attorney, draft one broad independent patent claim covering the invention, with 5 or fewer elements (not counting the preamble), each element covering at most a single potential point of novelty; mark the preamble with a '*' and mark each of the ;-separated elements with '~'",
    "prompt2": "Here is an independent patent claim, with the preamble marked with '*' and each element marked with '~': ${{prompt1Response}} re-write each of the claim elements such that the element includes any omitted antecedent basis, adding descriptive context where appropriate, such that the element could be understood in isolation without reference to any of the other elements or the preamble; for each element, use an indefinite article for the first instance of each term in that element; add preamble context to the element where helpful; put brackets around the one or more most relevant keyword(s) in each element; mark each of the ;-separated elements with '~'",
    "prompt3a": "System / Role Instruction: You are an expert in patent claim analysis and technical writing. Your task is to rewrite each claim element so that critical technical keywords are highlighted and extraneous language is minimized. The resulting text should be concise, focused on the key inventive concepts, and optimized for transformer-based semantic embeddings (e.g., BERT-like models). The goal is to improve vector similarity retrieval by emphasizing the core elements and functions of the claim elements. Here is a list of claim elements: {{prompt2Response}} User Instruction: For each claim element: Rewrite the element to emphasize the key technical terms and the main function of the claim element, while avoiding unnecessary or filler wording. Maintain clarity of the invention's purpose or structure. Keep sentence structure and wording concise to help transformer-based models create more accurate semantic embeddings. List of Claim Elements, each element marked with '~': Output Format:List of re-written claim elements optimized for embedding, each element marked with '~'",
    "prompt3b": "Here is an independent patent claim, with each element marked with '~': {{prompt3aResponse}}. System / Role Instruction: You are an expert in patent claim analysis and technical writing. Your task is to: For each element, put brackets around one or two keywords/phrases that are most relevant to patentability and are the minimum set of most important technical keyword(s)/phrase(s) that capture(s) the essential features, functional operation, novelty, and/or structure of the element, or are essential for comparison with prior art references for patentability analysis. Words or phrases that do not contribute substantially to the technical substance/meaning of the claim, or are merely legal, grammatical, formulaic, procedural, connective, or transitional, should not be bracketed. Confirm that only one or two words/phrases are bracketed in each element.",
    "prompt4": "Here is an independent patent claim, with the preamble marked with '*' and each element marked with '~': {{prompt3bResponse}} For each of the claim elements, determine whether the element is likely generic or potentially novel (i.e., could possibly be a point of novelty relative to the prior art as of {{date}}). Mark elements that are likely generic with '<G>' and elements that are potentially novel with '<N>'"
